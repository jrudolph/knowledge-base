# @jrudolph's Knowledge Base

## What's This?

A collection of computing resources and personal learnings collected by [me](https://virtual-void.net). It's mostly a
semi-structured way for me to keep links and insights.

It's published and public mostly because that's easiest for my own needs but also because sometimes people find similar
things useful.
